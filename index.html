  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  
  </div>

  <p>Hello, I am Nishant, a passionate geologist.
  I have a strong interest in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Currently, I am pursuing my studies in GIS at Fleming college Lindsay, ON, Canada.
  <p>I am from Ahmedabad-The vibrant city of India, where my journey as a geologist and my fascination for the world of rocks and landscapes began.
  My Journey to study in Canada was not only driven by my own ambitions but also to fulfill the dream of My Father.</p>
  <p>I hold a bachelorâ€™s degree in Geology, which provided me with a solid foundation in the earth sciences. 
  My academic journey has now led me to Canada, where I am furthering my expertise in GIS. 
  The fusion of geology and GIS has opened new horizons in understanding the Earth's dynamic processes and its ever-changing landscapes.
